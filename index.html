    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Oh No Waymo! is a fun game inspired by the classic car spotting game "Punch Buggy" (or "Slug Bug"). It's a great way to keep kids entertained on long car rides, and helps them learn to identify self-driving cars!</p>
    <ol class="rule">
      <li>Spot it, Shout it! The first player to shout "Oh No Waymo!" when they see a self-driving car wins a point.</li>
      <li>What's a Waymo? Explain to younger players that a Waymo is a self-driving car, which might have cameras or sensors on top and may not have a driver behind the wheel. You can also point out the specific features of the car in the picture, like the cameras and lidar on top.</li>
      <li>Be Specific (Optional): For an added challenge, players can earn bonus points for correctly identifying specific features of self-driving cars, like spinning LiDAR on the roof or cameras on the sides. (LiDAR is a laser system that helps self-driving cars see their surroundings.)</li>
      <li>Double Points! Earn double points if the self-driving car has a person in the driver's seat.  Maybe they're taking over control, or maybe they're just there for safety! </li>
      <li>Keep it Safe: This game is best played from a passenger seat. Remind players not to get distracted while looking for cars.</li>
      <li>Winning! Play until you get tired, reach a pre-determined point goal, or arrive at your destination. The player with the most points wins!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Bonus Rule</h2>
    <p>Want to add a bit more silly fun? Have a designated "Fake Out" car. Maybe it's a bright orange car, or a specific model. The first player to shout "Oh No Waymo!" for the Fake Out car loses a point! (Adult supervision recommended for this rule)</p>
    <h2>Remember</h2>
    <p>This is a game for fun! Be sure to keep it light and positive, and have fun spotting those self-driving cars!</p>
